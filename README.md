## Project Snapshot
- **Data Handling**: Clean and preprocess real-world (or sample) datasets.
- **Model Training**: Implement ML algorithms (e.g., regression, classification, or clustering).
- **Evaluation**: Assess performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to illuminate insights and model behaviors.

---

## Purpose
- Highlight how to set up a straightforward ML workflow in Google Colab.
- Provide a concise, interactive environment for exploring different modeling techniques.
- Demonstrate practical approaches to data analysis, feature engineering, and result validation.

---

## Key Insights
- Proper data preprocessing is crucial for reliable model outcomes.
- Tuning hyperparameters can significantly boost performance.
- Visualizations help clarify patterns, correlations, and anomalies.
