# Happiness Index Modeling 2024

This repository presents a supervised learning project aimed at predicting and interpreting a **Happiness Index** for the year 2024, built using various regression and classification techniques. The goal is to correlate a nation's social, economic, and demographic factors with its overall happiness level. This project was originally developed for my AP Research class.

## Project Highlights
- **Data-Driven Approach**  
  - Cleaned and standardized raw datasets involving metrics like GDP, social support, health expectancy, and freedom indices.  
- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Extracted key indicators (e.g., per capita income, literacy rate) and incorporated domain knowledge to bolster predictive power.  
- **Model Selection**  
  - Explored multiple supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to find optimal performance.  
- **Performance Metrics**  
  - Evaluated models based on R² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and accuracy (for classification-based approaches).  
- **Interpretability**  
  - Leveraged feature importance techniques to provide insights into which factors most heavily influence the predicted happiness score.

## Methodology Overview
1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**: Removed null entries, standardized numerical features, and encoded categorical variables.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualized correlations, distributions, and outliers to refine hypotheses.  
3. **Training & Validation**: Implemented train/test splits (or cross-validation) to assess generalization.  
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used grid/random search to fine-tune model parameters and improve accuracy.  
5. **Results & Insights**: Summarized best-performing model(s), discussed limitations, and proposed future enhancements.

## Key Takeaways
- **Economic Indicators** such as GDP and employment rates frequently ranked as top predictors.  
- **Social Factors** like perceived freedom and support networks also contribute significantly.  
- **Actionable Insights**: These findings can guide policymakers in prioritizing interventions to improve societal well-being.
